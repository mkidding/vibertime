## 🛑 The Problem: "The 4AM Loop"

We all know the meme: _"Sleeping is for the weak."_ It's funny on Reddit, but in reality, it's a burnout trap.

Vibe coding is addictive. It hits the same dopamine buttons as gambling—"Just one more prompt and it will work." You feel like a wizard, chaining LLM outputs and watching code appear from thin air.

Next thing you know, it's dawn, your eyes are burning, and you're debugging a race condition that didn't exist six hours ago.

## ⚡ The Solution

**Viber Time** is a Retro-Futuristic monitor designed to keep you in the flow state _without_ letting you drown in it.

### 🤖 Feature: Accomplishment Analysis
**See how much you and your AI accomplished together.**

*   **Biological Input**: Tracks your physical keyboard strokes.
*   **Synthetic Input**: Tracks code generated by AI or pasted.
*   **The Balance**: Tracks your time spent coding and reviewing.

### 🔋 Feature: Bedtime Reminder
**Your energy isn't infinite.**

*   **Target Bedtime**: Set a "Hard Stop" for your session.
*   **The Gentle Nudge**: The UI gently reminds you when it's time to disconnect.

### 🎰 Feature: Viber Slot Machine (Vibe Predict)
**Coding with AI feels like a gamble.**

Sometimes it's magic, sometimes it's hallucinations.

*   **Spin the Wheel**: Run the Slot Machine once a day to "predict" your vibe.
*   **Just for Fun**: A retro mini-game to break the tension of debugging.
